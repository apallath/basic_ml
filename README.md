# Basic machine learning algorithms

A collection of Jupyter notebooks I've written to try out basic ML algorithms (mostly scikit-learn implementations) on common datasets. The notebooks on pandas, classification and regression are from undergrad, and the notebook on clustering is from early-on in grad school.

## Pandas (pandas/pandas.ipynb)
- Dataframes

## Classification (supervised/classification_basic.ipynb,classification_adv.ipynb)
- k-Nearest Neighbours classification
- Logistic Regression
- Logistic Regression using polynomial features
- SVM with linear kernel, binary classification, multi-class classification
- Decision Tree
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Random Forest

## Regression (supervised/regression.ipynb)
- k-Nearest Neighbours regression
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression (Regularization)
- Ridge Regression with feature scaling
- Polynomial Regression

## Clustering (unsupervised/clustering.ipynb)
- k-Means Clustering
- DBSCAN
- Spectral Clustering
- Markov Clustering (markov_clustering Python module)
