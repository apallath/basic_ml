# Learning Applied Machine Learning

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks I've written while learning the basics of (applied) Machine Learning (and data science).

Resources consulted while preparing these notebooks are listed in the first markdown cell of each notebook.

Python libraries used: numpy, matplotlib, pandas, scikit-learn

Pandas (pandas/pandas.ipynb)
- Dataframes

Classification (supervised/classification_basic.ipynb,classification_adv.ipynb)
- k-Nearest Neighbours classification
- Logistic Regression
- Logistic Regression using polynomial features
- SVM with linear kernel, binary classification, multi-class classification
- Decision Tree
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Random Forest

Regression (supervised/regression.ipynb)
- k-Nearest Neighbours regression
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression (Regularization)
- Ridge Regression with feature scaling
- Polynomial Regression

Clustering (unsupervised/clustering.ipynb)
- k-Means clustering
